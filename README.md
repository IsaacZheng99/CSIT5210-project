# CSIT5210-project
This is the group project for CSIT5210 2023 Fall HKUST.

## 1. Load Data
In this project, we use the "coil-100" dataset and you can use the `get_dataset()` function in the `get_data.py` file to generator the data.

## 2. Caculate dc-dist
The algorithms in this project is based on the "density-connectivity based distance". You can use the `get_dc_dist_matrix()` function in the `distance_metric.py` file to get the dc-dist matrix.
